  "summary": "The overall system health is currently compromised due to two critical failure clusters. The first cluster, characterized by high-severity timeout issues during user actions, significantly impacts user experience and system responsiveness. The second cluster involves high-severity invalid currency errors during transactions, which poses a serious risk to financial operations and user trust. Engineering teams should prioritize addressing these timeout issues and transaction errors to restore system reliability and enhance user satisfaction. Immediate action is essential to mitigate these risks and improve overall system performance.",
