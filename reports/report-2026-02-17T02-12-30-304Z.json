  "summary": "The overall system health is currently compromised due to two critical failure clusters. The first cluster, characterized by high-severity timeout issues during user actions, significantly impacts user experience and system responsiveness. The second cluster involves high-severity invalid currency errors during transactions, which poses a risk to financial integrity and user trust. Engineering priority should focus on resolving these timeout issues and addressing the currency validation process to restore system reliability and enhance user satisfaction. Immediate action is essential to mitigate these high-impact issues and improve overall system performance.",

Further investigation into system performance metrics and resource utilization during the tests is recommended to confirm this.",

Further investigation into the specific transaction data and validation rules applied during these tests is necessary to confirm the exact source of the errors.",
