  "summary": "The overall system health is currently at risk due to critical issues identified in two failure clusters. The most pressing concern is Cluster 1, which has a high severity level attributed to timeouts, indicating potential performance bottlenecks that need immediate attention. Additionally, Cluster 2 presents a medium severity issue related to invalid currency failures, which could impact user transactions and overall user experience. Engineering should prioritize addressing the timeout failures in Cluster 1 to enhance system reliability, followed by resolving the currency validation issues in Cluster 2 to ensure transactional integrity. Immediate action in these areas is essential to maintain system stability and user satisfaction.",
